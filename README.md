## Goals

The goal of Corner is to become the de-facto on-ramp for conversational AI.

Open, easy-to-use, easy-to-customize, easy-to-extend, system agnostic.

Removing the need for end-users to wait until providers ship their own desktop experiences, whilst offering providers the ability to offer desktop support without needing to reallocate valuable engineering resources.

Corner is intended to be a solid unopinionated foundation for AI workflows.

Use frontier models at-cost by providing your own API keys.

Extend and contribute to the Corner ecosystem with your own plugins to add support for your own AI tools and workflows.

Customize Corner to your liking with themes.
