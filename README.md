## Goals

The goal of Lex is to become the de-facto on-ramp for AI models.
Open, easy-to-use, easy-to-customize, easy-to-extend.

Removing the need for end-users to wait until providers ship their own desktop experiences, whilst offering providers the ability to offer desktop support without needing to reallocate valuable engineering resources.

Lex is intended to be a solid unopinionated foundation for AI workflows.

Use frontier models at-cost by providing your own API keys.

Extend and contribute to the Lex ecosystem with your own plugins to add support for your own AI tools and workflows.
Customize Lex to your liking with themes.
